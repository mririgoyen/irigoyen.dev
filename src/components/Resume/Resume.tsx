            <p>As a senior software engineer, I worked in a continuously delivered React and Node.js microservice environment. Regularly, I took the lead on designing or implementing new functionality for our SaaS-based applications. I continuously worked to improve the quality of my code through extensive unit and integration testing, as well as employed functional programming techniques and good coding patterns. Additionally, I explored DevOps related tasks that could help improve the quality of life for the engineering team.</p>
            <p>As a scrum master, I facilitated and created opportunities each sprint for the team to succeed. I consistently researched, analyzed, and experimented to ensure our Scrum process ran smoothly and without interruption so the team could focus on their goals.</p>

            <p>I maintained a cloud-hosted LAMP stack which hosted approximately a dozen separate sites. I engineered solutions for our cloud-hosted stack to securely communicate with locally hosted resources. I also created a custom content management system (CMS) in PHP to showcase our home inventory on the web. Through storyboarding and market research, I designed a visually stunning web front-end on top of the CMS in HTML and JavaScript. Additionally, I developed standalone web applications for large touchscreen kiosks in several of our physical sales centers.</p>

            <p>I studied Technology at Illinois State University, because I enjoyed learning about a wide variety of topics. The technology program offered opportunities to explore computer operating systems and hardware, networking, electronics, and programming, instead of focusing on just one specific area. This allowed me to focus on the topics I found the most interesting as I moved into my professional career, while also having a well-rounded background to critically attack any problem I encountered.</p>
